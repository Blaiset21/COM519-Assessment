Overview

This project was developed as part of a university assessment for the COM519 module and focuses on building a data-driven application using Python and MongoDB. The core concept centers around a Warhammer army tracker, designed to help users manage and monitor their collections, units, and stats in an organized way.

The application demonstrates practical use of database integration, allowing users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on army data stored in a MongoDB database. It serves both as a functional tool for tabletop enthusiasts and a technical showcase of Python programming with NoSQL database interaction. This project helped strengthen my understanding of database design, Python logic structuring, and user-focused application development.
